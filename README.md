# Java: Data Structures and Algorithms

- Este README está disponível em [português do Brasil 🇧🇷](readme/README_pt-br.md).

In this repository I gathered together all the data structures and algorithms that I have learned so far, alongside
with those I plan to study in the nearly future. As for the source code development, I used the Java programming
language with test-first approach (FKA TDD) to guarantee the consistency of the code while keeping my productivity
high.

## Table of content:

| Data Structures                             | Algorithms       |

| ❌ Doubly Linked List                        | ❌ Bubble Sort    |
| ❌ Stack                                     | ❌ Selection Sort |
| ❌ Queue                                     | ❌ Insertion Sort |
| ❌ Binary Tree                               | ❌ Merge Sort     |
| ❌ Hash Table                                | ❌ Quicksort      |
| ❌ Graph                                     | ❌ Tree Traversal |

Items prefixed with a check (✅) are those I already finished studying and have successfully implemented the
source code. Feel free to click on any of them to have a brief explanation of it and see what methods I have
implemented for that particular item.

Items prefixed with a cross-check (❌) are those I'm currently studying or are on my waiting list for future research.

I will keep updating this repository until the day that there are no cross-checks.
